# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a statistical method that identifies patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform for each task.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal: Learn mapping from input to output
- Examples: Classification, Regression

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data
- Goal: Discover hidden patterns
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Goal: Maximize cumulative reward
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics
